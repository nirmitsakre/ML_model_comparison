# ML_model_comparison
Here we compare ML models for Classifying cancer dataset.
We used 4 supervised learning models for this classification, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN).
Each model require highly similar code lines.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to evaluate the best classifier for the given dataset.
